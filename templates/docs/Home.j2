            Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings,
            including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover
            entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can
            easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 50 million sites use
            Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages.
            Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others
            already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.

            Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex,
            Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg">community</a> process,
            using the <a
            href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg">public-schemaorg@w3.org</a>
             mailing list and through <a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg">GitHub</a>.

           A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide
           on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts.
           It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the
           larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas.
